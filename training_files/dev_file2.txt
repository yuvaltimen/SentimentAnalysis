ID-1082	The food was good. I went during a winter snowstorm and they were one of the few restaurants open. It's cozy. They have that orange-y tone inside the restaurant. Service was good.	1
ID-1083	Love this place! The service is impeccable. They always make sure you get what you want! However the menu isn’t right online, which I didn’t like. They must have increased the drink prices. But the food is amazing and service unbeatable. Great price for what you get!	1
ID-1084	Worst customer service ever!!! 0 star!! We ordered chicken patties and only to find out that the lady gave us beef patties and we got charged 14, 72 extra, when we called the first thing the guy said is “Stop whispering” and when we got there they started yelling l at us saying we must have went to another flames that is why we got charged twice; and they didn’t want to take the patties back saying that the lady had told us that  they don’t have chicken patties; the other old lady even lied and said that she heard her when she said that. I was so shocked because in my life I had never experienced such horrible customer service..I’m so disappointed and never coming back again !	0
ID-1085	Good food but way too expensive.	0
ID-1086	SPOILED rice and veggies. The meat and gravy tastes great but after having spoiled food and stomach poisoning third time this year. I will NOT be getting food from here anymore. 1st time I thought I was tripping, but after 3rd occurence in the last 3 months I've decided to bring awareness to this issue. I will be contacting the border of health on this issue.	0
ID-1087	I am telling you, they provide a big portion of meat. Chicken stew, chicken curry and Oxtails are the best. Go for extra meat, quantity is superb.	1
ID-1088	Good food. Sister in law loves the oxtail plate. Coconut cake is awesome.	1
ID-1089	The lady who served us was really rude. The salmon didn’t tasted like salmon at all, it seems that it was a leftleftleftleftover.	0
