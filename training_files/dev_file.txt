ID-1264	I recently went to the Aulani Resort and Spa for a staycation for 3 days. Our party consisted of 3 females and 3 males all between the ages of 25 and 30 and we all found the hotel a great place to spend a few days to relax and be a kid again. We had breakfast with Hawaiian themed Disney characters such as Goofy, Mickey, and Minnie which was fun. Playing in the large pool and relaxing in the man-made creek was a great place to be. 3 in our party went to the spa and all came back relaxed and refreshed while my girlfriend, her friend and I went to play on the water slides and generally have a good time. The setting of the hotel is beautiful beside a salt water lagoon. The night before we left we had a delicious dinner at the Ama'ama restaurant. It was sad to get back to reality once we finished.	1
ID-0841	I stayed at the Quality Inn in Hinesville Ga, and did not like it. My first impression was they got to be joking. There is no quality in Quality Inn. Just old bed spreadings that were so thin that could see right through them. The corners of my room was dusty with crumbs and the bathroom was ruined with rust. The beds was not comfortable at all. I was not very happy with the room and will never go there again.	0
ID-1224	Hampton Inn and Suites in Lakeland Florida was a great place to stay! We stayed for a Dance competition for my daughter who is 12. the staff was great, the rooms were all on the same floor and we even had a free hot breakfast! I loved this hotels location, it was in the middle of a shopping mall and the girls loved to go out there and walk around or go to the movies all while staying at the hotel A+ Location and service!	1
ID-1011	I stayed at this days inn hotel for 5 days and bill was over $250.00 way to much for this uncomfortable stay. Located near the main street and highway so it was a lot of noise all day and night. Reminded me of an old motel. Smelled musty and molded. No swimming pool!	0
ID-1274	Absolutely a great hotel for families! The rooms are spacious, restaraunts are very kid-friendly, and the pool area is gorgeous. My children felt like they were at a water park, not just another hotel. We will definitely return for another stay here!	1
ID-1146	We had an incredible stay at The XV Beacon. It started with an upgrade to a gorgeous room. The hotel is in a quaint part of Boston hand the rooms are on the smaller side. However, this is made up for with the service and the decor. The room is so luxurious and comfortable. The bed linens are the highest quality I have ever seen in a hotel. The bath products are amazing as well. Everywhere you look there are wonderful details. from bowls of fruit for the taking throughout the hotel to embossed leather walls in the elevator. The staff knew us by name each time we passed through the lobby and always went out of their way to be friendly towards our young daughter. The location can't be beat either. it's like staying with a friend in their brownstone in Beacon Hill. I would never stay anywhere else in Boston.	1
ID-1007	I recently stayed at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a regular guest at Red Rock Station Casino, their sister property. I was enticed to stay at Aliante because of a deep discount they were offering. However, our experience was so bad that the hotel should have paid US! The directions on the hotel's website were outdated. The route took at least half an hour longer than if they had taken another freeway. We finally arrived and got up to our room. Despite opening less than a year ago, our room had many things broken or missing. Lights were burnt out, the television remote did not work unless we sat one inch in front of the television, our bathroom toiler paper holder was ripped from the wall and the sink water pressure was horrendous. They also forgot to stock our minibar, despite checking in much later than the usual arrival time. We tried to ignore the poorly-maintained room by dining and gambling downstairs. We first tried their cafe. The service was horribly slow and the food was tasteless. We next tried their Pancake House. The food was covered in vinegar and was disgusting. After those two meals, we drove to the nearest grocery store and prepared the remainder of our meals in the room or ate at restaurants off of the property. I shared my complaints with the reservation agent upon checking out and he did not seem to care. I will never stay at this location again!	0
ID-0795	This hotel was mediocre. It did not live up to the hilton hype. It was not priced correctly for the service I got. It was nothing in particular that caught my eye. The lobby looked like a HG t.v. magazine threw up in it. The indoor pool might as well had been outside due to the fact it was a random pigeon flying about freely. The food was not as well prepared as I had expected. The menu was drab and had a small selection. I really thought I was ordering from a kids menu. The room I was in had such a filthy carpet. It was like the people before me threw a party then checked out when I checked in. The bed was ok, but for 123 dollars a nite it should have been stellar. The bathroom was also a little let down. The tub could barely fit my husband. I would not ask anyone to pay for a stay here. I paid the hilton price for a motel six stay.	0
ID-0843	This Hotel is filthy, bedbugs, dirt, mold, the bedding looked dirty. There is only one person that runs the front desk and he is old and does not speak english. I could not get a refund for my stay and I wanted to get out of this place as soon as I walked into the room. There are obvious drug users and other illegal activity on the premises. I would never stay here again. The front desk operator is rude and the place is not worth what I paid for it. If I wanted to pay for bedbugs and filth I wouldnt have had a problem with the place. They alley would have been cleaner and probably safer. STAY AWAY!!!!	0
ID-1232	i recently visited The W hotel in New Orleans(downtown)for the first time and it was best hotel ive ever been too. First of all, the hotel is beautiful!! The valet is prompt and courteous. I was even given a bottle of Voss water upon entrance...for free!! The check-in girl was polite and gave me a free room upgrade. My room was immaculate and beautifully decorated. later that night i ordered room service and the food was hot and fresh. i requested a wake up call the next morning and i did receive it on the dot.  Checkout was a breeze and so was retrieval of my vehicle. overall, i give this hotel two thumbs up!	1
ID-1025	I have stayed at The Inn At The Convention Center for a total of one week on separate occasions. First, if you can get past the curt responses of the near inhuman clerks in the front office, you will make your way into one of the worst hotel experiences of your life. Taking a trip in the elevator feels as if it will be your last. It is squeaky, smells strongly of cleaning detergents, and runs slowly. Once you arrive on your floor, the smell of cleaning agents is even stronger than the smell of the elevator. It buries itself into one's pores and haunts your entire stay. As for the location, it's true that the Inn At The Convention Center is near major freeways and minutes from downtown, but the area it's located in is terrible, offering nothing in the way of good food or culture. It is a haven for young party animals, noise included. Additionally, the wi-fi is terrible, if and when it works at all.You would be better off saving your money for a different hotel in a different location. You won't be sorry you did.	0
ID-0799	I recently stayed at the Astor Crown Plaza in New Orleans for a work seminar. My seminar was being held in another hotel in the French Quarter, so I felt that it would be best for me to stay in the French Quarter as well. I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer. The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping! I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out. I went back to my room assuming that it would be refilled at some point that night or the next morning. The next night, I tried again - no water. I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water! All in all, the location of this hotel is fine, but customer service, and water, seem to be lacking quite a bit! I will be returning to the French Quarter but not to this hotel.	0
ID-0879	This hotel smelled like smoke everywhere, not just on the smoking floors. There was also a mix-up about our reservations before we arrived, they got it worked out but it involved some inconvenience for us. The breakfast selections were paltry, just a few sad pastries and some fruit, not the full, hot breakfast we were led to believe we would have. Overall, this hotel was not the worst but it was just disappointing in many ways. Next time I find myself in Grand Junction, Colorado I will choose to stay somewhere else!	0
ID-1136	I was very impressed with the hotel. The exterior of the hotel was one thing, which is simply marvelous, but it was probably the roomiest hotel in the Concord, NH area. It is close to my brother's school, had excellent service and pretty nifty free toiletry, nice bathrooms, free internet connection and more. The attendants were very attentive, and I would love to stay there again if not for the price.	1
ID-0977	This is one of the worst places to stay. The hotel is next to railroad tracks, and the trains were running and blowing the horn day and night. When the train wasn't loud, the traffic on the busy street nearby was. The rooms were dirty and had some empty soda bottles in it. Our room was still not ready two hours after we were told it would be ready. We were so desperate to get in our room to change our clothes for a family reunion that we helped the maid make the bed. Do not stay here.	0
ID-0899	I didn't enjoy my experience in this hotel because their were insects in my hotel room and it seemed very dirty.	0
ID-0929	When I visited this hotel, I thought everything was going to be great. It's appearance was not too shabby, but as soon as I got to the room, my opinion began to change. The room was nowhere near the quality that the rest of the hotel was; it only came with the basics, and nothing more. I would have expected more from a nicer hotel. The other surprising thing about this hotel was the staff. I did not feel secure at all. When I first came to my room to find my wife, she was not there (and I did not have a key). I simply came to the door, knocked, and waited one second. The maid down the hall came over and let me in the room. I could have been some stranger that was knocking on someone's room! I will not go back to that hotel because of this safety issue. Thank you.	0
ID-1228	I had a wonderful, relaxed stay at the Huntley Hotel. I wasn't staying in the priciest room, but all the staff treated me like I had reserved the penthouse. The desk clerk even helped me locate my wallet after I left it in the hotel restaurant. In addition to beautiful rooms and a kind staff, the Huntley boasts a location barely two blocks from the Santa Monica beach. When I wasn't enjoying the amenities of the hotel, I was lounging in the sun.	1
ID-1082	This hotel is conveniently located just blocks from the world-famous Waikiki beach. The room price was very reasonable, and the hotel had a lot of great amenities, such as a pool, hot tub, bar, restaurant, and gift shop. The room was quite comfortable with a great view of the city, although I know that for a little more money nightly, the hotel also provides rooms that have an ocean view. The room was secure. It had a nice bathroom with a hair dryer. It also had a closet with hangers, and an ironing board and iron. There was a fairly large safe in the room where I could store important belongings while I was out, just for added security. There was a television, a refrigerator, and a coffee pot. There was also internet for a small daily fee. The hotel is not only located close to the beach, but also to a lot of shops and restaurants. It is right on the bus line, so it is very easy to just walk outside the hotel and catch a bus to virtually anywhere on the island, including the Manoa neighborhood, the zoo, or even to Hanauma Bay, which is about an hour's drive away from the Waikiki area. Furthermore, I really liked the hotel lobby--it is a nice open air lobby with tables to sit at and have breakfast. There is a lovely fountain and koi pond. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is on a budget, but would like to experience Hawaii nonetheless.	1
